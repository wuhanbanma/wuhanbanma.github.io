        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            As generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, it poses unique challenges and opportunities within the legal landscape. 
            The intersection of generative AI and law raises critical questions regarding intellectual property, liability, ethical use, and the regulation of AI-generated content. 
            This workshop aims to explore these challenges and discuss potential responses from legal, regulatory, and ethical perspectives.

        <h2>Paper Submission</h2>
        <p>
            All submissions should use IEEE two-column style. Templates are the same as those for the main conference (TAL 2024). 
            All papers must be submitted electronically through the paper submission system in PDF format only. 
            AITL 2024 accepts long research papers (6-8 pages) and short research papers (4-6 pages). The page count includes the references.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paper review will be double-blind, and submissions not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review. 
            Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. 
            Papers must be clearly submitted in English and will be selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the workshop to present the work. 
            Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements and indexed by EI. 
            The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. 
            The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.
